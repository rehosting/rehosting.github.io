title: State of the Art

We have identified four broad approaches to rehosting: pure emulation, hardware-in-the-loop emulation, symbolic modeling of peripherals, and hybrid systems that combine several of these strategies simultaneously. Our taxonomy is split into these four categories:
* [Pure Emulation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tables/pure_emulation.md %})
* [Hardware-in-the-loop]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tables/partial_emulation.md %})
* [Symbolic Abstractions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tables/symbolic_abstractions.md %})
* [Hybrid Approaches]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tables/hybrid_approaches.md %})

We have created the following figure to summarize the relationships between rehosting systems to date. Check out the State of the Art taxonomy to learn more about individual systems.
