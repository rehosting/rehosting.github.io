# Q: What does the "target type" column mean?

The types are adopted from the paper "[What You Corrupt Is Not What You Crash: Challenges in Fuzzing Embedded Devices"](http://s3.eurecom.fr/docs/ndss18_muench.pdf), which categorizes embedded devices and firmware based on the deployed operating system.

In short, the different system types are:
* **Type 0**: Not an embedded system
* **Type 1**: System based on a general purpose OS retrofitted for embedded application
* **Type 2**: System with operating system specifically created for embedded targets
* **Type 3**: System with no operating system abstraction at all, running "bare-metal" firmware

# Q: I found a mistake, what should I do?

Great! Mistakes can happen and we are happy to fix them.
Feel free to open a issue on our [github repository](https://github.com/rehosting/rehosting.github.io/issues) to kick off discussion with us!

# Q: How do I add a new rehosting system?

First, fork and clone our repository:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:[your_github_user_name]/rehosting.github.io.git
$ cd rehosting.github.io.git
```

Afterwards, copy the [`template.yml`](https://github.com/rehosting/rehosting.github.io/blob/main/assets/template.yml) file into the the `_data` directory, using the system name as destination name:
```shell
$ cp assets/template.yml _data/awesome_new_system.yml
```

Now edit the new `.yml` file to your liking; `|` denotes options from which you will have to choose. Once done, you can test if everything renders correctly locally (requires a local installation of ruby and Bundler):
```shell
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, if everything succeeded, you should be able to see your local copy of this website at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`. If everything is to your liking, push your updates and send us your pull request!
